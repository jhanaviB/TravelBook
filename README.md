# Travel-Agency-Management-System
We aim to design and develop a comprehensive database management system for a travel agency to manage its operations such as customer information efficiently, booking details, itinerary management and financial transactions.

# Features
With the help of travel agency database management system, we will be able to perform the following features:

**1. Customer Management**
* Insert, update and delete customer information such as name, contact details, preferences etc.
* View customer details, booking history, etc.

**2. Booking Management**
* Create, modify, and cancel bookings for flights, hotels, tours, and transportation services.
* Create and update booking confirmations for customers.

**3. Inventory Management**
* Maintain a database of available flights, hotels, rental cars, and tour packages.
* Update inventory using transactions to manage bookings and prevent overbooking.

**4. Itinerary Planning**
* Maintain a database of itinerary of available locations, estimated budget, etc.
* Allow agents to update, insert or delete itinerary information such as location, budget, etc.

**5. Financial Transactions**
* Generate invoice for each booking by verifying account details, balance etc using transactions.

**6. Interaction with Database using ChatCompletion API**
* Generate a MySQL query by converting a simple instruction in English using OpenAIâ€™s APIs. 
* If the generated query is correct, execute the query and provide results.
* If the generated query is incorrect, the user can type the query and execute it to get the results.
